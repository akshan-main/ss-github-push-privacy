# Privacy Policy — StrataScratch GitHub Push

Last updated: 2026-01-11

## What this extension does
This extension saves my StrataScratch solutions to my GitHub repository when I mark a solution as solved.

## Data the extension handles
- GitHub configuration that I enter (owner/org, repository name, branch, base folder)
- A GitHub personal access token that I enter
- The solution text I write in the StrataScratch editor (SQL/Python/R)

## How the data is used
- The configuration and token are used to authenticate with the GitHub API.
- The solution text is used to create or update a file in the configured GitHub repository.

## Where data is stored
- Configuration and token are stored locally in the browser (Chrome extension local storage).
- The extension does not operate its own servers.

## Data sharing
- The extension sends solution text to GitHub only, using the GitHub API, to write files in my repository.
- The extension does not sell or share data with advertisers, analytics providers, or other third parties.

## Data retention
- Local settings remain stored until I remove the extension or clear extension storage.
- Solutions remain in my GitHub repository until I delete them from GitHub.

## Security
- The GitHub token is stored locally. I can revoke/rotate it at any time in GitHub.
